# What's up with Substack's front-end JavaScript app for comments?

TL/DR: Lots.

## It puts all visible comments into the DOM

A comments page with thousands of comments is lengthy. Rendering all of them at once demands a lot of the browser and device. So don't do that. 
Put into the DOM only the stuff that would be visible to the user through the viewport scrolled to its current position.

How do you imagine apps like Google Photos allow me to scroll through 50 thousand pics collected over 20 years with a nice responsive UX?

Substack comments is a single page app so why not?

## It polls for new comments every 3 seconds

Scenario: a page with thousands of comments. The user has for a while been browsing, reading, commenting, clicking 
the `Load_More` and `N_Replies` buttons to fill in the gaps. The DOM is now big and complex as described above.
So the browser is already working extra hard (CPU, battery, energy) to just display it all.

Then every three seconds it fetches from

    https://XXX.substack.com/api/v1/post/POSTID/comments?token=&all_comments=true&sort=best_first

and every response is a JSON doc of the same 246 comments. And processing every response overloads the browser and it 
freezes. This makes the afore mentioned browsing, reading, commenting, clicking difficult.

## The DOM is unnecesarily complex

Let's take a look at **one** public comment with **one** reply

```html

This is repeated thousands of times.

I'm not sure I'm up to the task of explaining *all* the problems here but...

- Why all the embedded SVG documents? It's ok to paste the same SVG a handful of times but not tens or hundreds, let alone thousands.
- Why all the forms? The user (and therefore DOM) doesn't need a reply comment form until someone clicks a `Reply` button. Insert the form then!
- `<a href="javascript:void(0)">` really? `<sigh />` 
- Why all the `style` attributes, like `style="position: absolute; top: -10000px; left: -10000px;"`?

Just optimizing this stuff, which would be a few hours work and a few more testing, might make a big improvment.


## That adds up

[Here is a public Substack page with 334 comments](https://greenwald.substack.com/p/violence-in-the-capitol-dangers-in-bbe/comments) (at the time I exported it). [Here's the DOM it generates](https://fsbdoc.s3.amazonaws.com/subparstack-comments.html) exported as HTML. It has content-type `text/plain` to make it easier for your browser to display. Even so mine is having a hard time. Try rendering it and watch performance remembering that's without any JavaScript stinking up the joint!


## XHR activity

From the network acticity console I see the comments app polling for new comments to display

![Network view of XHR](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17387120/106902064-650f6e80-66c6-11eb-8e86-d0b35a0ea070.png)

This raises a few questions:

- Why return 100 KiB of data every three seconds even when there are no changes to the comments since the last poll?

- Why return these particular comments?

- Why the same comments every time?

- Why not return only changes since the last poll?

### UPDATE 2021-01-19

> Today we're seeing much larger XHR responses. About 900 KiB. This might be part of an attempt by Substack 
to mitigate the [email links dont work bug](https://github.com/subparstack/subparstack/issues/2)

The timing of these requests isn't really a problem for users but suggests a design that's wasteful of resources.  Most database
performance problems can be solved by throwing money at them (hardware and energy) but some are easily optimized with a
change in the code. I suspect there are big gains to be made there but that's not our focus in looking at the webapp.

Here come the problems for end users like me:

![initial waterfall](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17387120/106902037-5cb73380-66c6-11eb-890a-cbad50474a54.png)

That's the response on initial display of the comments section.

Then I expand the comments (clicking `Load_More` and `N_Replies` buttons, takes a long time, and several clicks of the `Wait` button when Firefox displays  
![Slow web page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17387120/106901997-51fc9e80-66c6-11eb-8c54-1d7f5086043f.png)

Now here's the waterfall timing while I do nothing with the UI, I just let the XHR timer run. Actually it's an interval timer (ffs) so polling rate doesn't slow down with the browser. There's another quick and cheap way to make things better for users: slow down the XHR as needed to give the browser and user a chance at getting scheduled on the CPU.

![XHR waterfall](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17387120/106902050-62147e00-66c6-11eb-93fa-b5ce882203c3.png)

Poor browser doesn't stand a chance, does it? It's completely frozen for more than half the time.

Btw: if your device is running off a battery, don't leave this browser window open.


# Summary

I only just got started and I can see a few very simple things that could be changed that might suffice to make this SPA perform acceptably.

Really, I don't think this is my job. I pay to *use* Substack comments.


## UPDATE Feb 12 2021

Maybe Substack has paid some attention and noticed how much we can inspect their app using the browser console. When I opened it today to expand comments I foudn this
